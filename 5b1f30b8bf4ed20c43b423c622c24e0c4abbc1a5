      "message": "You guys don\u0027t do a component name in these? Like \"swift-ring-status: blah blah error\"? Otherwise it\u0027s going to be an annoying problem for someone to find out _what_ \"works on live-system only\". Not worth -1 maybe, but something that jumps on me by contrast with overall competency of the script (so many people forget to error to stderr in scripts, but this one is good).",
