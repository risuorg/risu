      name: Verify all deployed nodes have their clock synchronised.
      description: >
        Each overcloud node should have their clocks synchronised.
        The deployment should configure and run ntpd. This validation verifies
        that it is indeed running and connected to an NPT server on all nodes.

      - post-deployment
  tasks:
  - name: Run ntpstat
    # ntpstat returns 0 if synchronised and non-zero otherwise
    command: ntpstat
