# How to review a code change

Check out the PR submitted locally to validate (UT's, etc are already run from GH side)

1.  If everything passes successfully, perform a sample usage on available sosreport

        `~/risu/risu/risu.py sosreportfolder`

1.  Provide comments and feedback on the PR page for the proposed change

## Things to review

Below are some examples of things we do usually review:

- Use of `LANG=C` before commands we later grep to avoid end user localization to affect the strings we try to grep
- Use of `${var}` vs `$var`
- Not mangle `RISU\_` variables (usually leftovers when testing without using the provided `env-for-debug.sh` variable)
- Trailing spaces on lines or empty lines
- Reuse as maximum code between Live and snapshot mode
  - Use TRAP to generate files we might see in Live and use vars for it, for example:

  ```sh
  if [[ ${RISU_LIVE} -eq 0 ]]; then
      FILE="${RISU_ROOT}/sos_commands/networking/ip_address"
  elif [[ ${RISU_LIVE} -eq 1 ]];then
      FILE=$(mktemp)
      trap "rm ${FILE}" EXIT
      ip address  > ${FILE} 2>&1
  fi
  ```

  - In this way, we do refer to same file in our `is_required` or `is_lineinfile` syntax and we do reuse the maximum code for the script
