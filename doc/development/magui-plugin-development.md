## Writing plugins

Magui plugins should conform to the following standards:

- Written in python and stored in the `maguiclient/plugins` folder following whatever desired hierarchy (for example, try to match Risu plugins structure for simplicity in filtering)
- Implement some base functions keeping arguments and data returned as in others:
  - `init()`
    - Returns list of triggers (array with strings) (contains Risu plugin ID data to act on)
  - `run(data)`
    - Returns information that is later shown by magui
  - `help()`
    - Returns string with description of plugin

- Plugins for Magui should refer to processing of Risu data for doing it's work
  - In order to do so, each Risu plugins has a unique UID calculated via md5sum via relative path and plugin name.
  - Results are then filtered to get the data for that plugin ID, for example:

    ```py
    # Plugin ID to act on:
    # "131c0e0d785fae9811f2754262f0da9e"
    # Note that this ID is returned via 'triggers' in the init function, so only the data that this plugin can process is provided.

    returncode = risu.RC_OKAY

    message = ""
    for ourdata in data:
        # 'err' in this case should be always equal to the md5sum of the file so that we can report the problem
        err = []
        for sosreport in ourdata["sosreport"]:
            err.append(ourdata["sosreport"][sosreport]["err"])

        if len(sorted(set(err))) != 1:
            message = _(
                "Pipeline.yaml contents differ across sosreports, please do check that the contents are the same and shared across the environment to ensure proper behavior."
            )
            returncode = risu.RC_FAILED

    out = ""
    err = message
    return returncode, out, err
    ```
