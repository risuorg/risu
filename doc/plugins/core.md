## Writing checks

Risu tests should conform to the following standards:

- The test script must be executable. Risu will ignore tests for
  which it does not have execute permission (and report CI errors if there's a file which has not +x set in the plugins folder)

- Test should include a line starting with `# description:`, `# long_name`, `# priority` and optional `# bugzilla` followed with a one line comment which describes plugin information, for example:

  ```sh
  # description: This plugins does check answer for Universe and everything
  # long_name: This is a tests for emulating Deep Tought answers
  # priority: 500
  # bugzilla: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=746698
  ```

- The test should return one of the following error codes to indicate
  the test result:
  - \$RC_OKAY -- success
  - \$RC_FAILED -- failure
  - \$RC_SKIPPED -- skipped
  - \$RC_INFO -- info

- Plugin output should we written to STDERR, for example with:

  ```
  echo "This test has failed" >&2
  ```

  - Additionally strings that would be interesting to 'translate', should be preceded by \$ like:

    ```
    echo $"This test has failed" >&2
    ```

  - In the same way that for python scripts using i18n you'll be using `_("string")`
  - This will allow `extractpot.sh` to use bash to dump strings in bash scripts that could be later translated with `poedit`.

A test may make use of the following standard environment variables:

- `$RISU_ROOT` -- tests that parse files should locate them
  relative to this directory. For example, if your script needs to
  examine `/etc/sysctl.conf`, it might have something like:

```sh
if grep -q '^net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1' "${RISU_ROOT}/etc/sysctl.conf"; then
  ...
fi
```

- `$RISU_LIVE` -- if `0`, tests are running against a filesystem
  snapshot of some sort. Tests should not attempt to use commands
  that interrogate the system on which it is running. If this
  variable is `1`, the tests are running on a live system.

- `$RISU_BASE` -- this is location of the risu folder.

- `$PLUGIN_BASEDIR` -- this contains the folder of the plugin that is being executed.
  The `$PLUGIN_BASEDIR` can be used to source files within the plugin folder.

## Common Functions

We provide helper script `common-functions.sh` to help define
location of various files. To use this script you can source it at the top:

```sh
# Load common functions
[ -f "${RISU_BASE}/common-functions.sh" ] && . "${RISU_BASE}/common-functions.sh"
```

### List of implemented functions

- `$systemctl_list_units_file` -- if tests are running against a filesystem
  snapshot of some sort. This variable can be used to easier identify the
  systemctl list units file.

- `$journalctl_file` -- if tests are running against a filesystem
  snapshot of some sort. This variable can be used to easier identify the
  systemctl list units file.

- `iniparser` -- parses ini file and returns value in lowercase
  - Example:
    ```sh
    if [[ "$(iniparser $config_file DEFAULT debug)" == "true" ]]; then
        echo "debug enabled in $config_file"
    fi
    ```

- `is_active $service` -- reports if service is active either based on live or snapshoot
  - Example:
    ```sh
    if is_active ntpd; then echo "NTP Running";fi
    ```

- `is_required_file $file` -- continues if file exists or exits `$RC_SKIPPED` if doesn't
  - Example:
    ```sh
    is_required_file "${RISU_ROOT}/var/log/messages"
    ```

- `discover_osp_version $openstack-nova-common-version_package` -- echos osp version based on `openstack-nova-common version`
  - Example:
    ```sh
    if [[ "$(discover_osp_version)" -eq "10" ]]; then echo "We're Newton";fi
    ```

- `name_osp_version $openstack-nova-common-version_package` -- echos osp version 'codename' based on `openstack-nova-common version`
  - Example:
    ```sh
    if [[ "$(name_osp_version)" -eq "pike" ]]; then echo "We're Pike!";fi
    ```

* `is_process $process` -- returns if process exists on the system
  - Example:
    ```sh
    if is_process ntpd; then echo "NTP Running!";fi
    ```

* `is_lineinfile $pattern $files` -- returns if pattern match is found in file
  - Example:
    ```sh
    if is_lineinfile "^debug[ \t]*=[ \t]*true" "$config_file"; then echo "Debug enabled."; fi
    ```

* `is_required_containerized` -- continues if environment is containerized works only against OSP12 and later
  - Example:
    ```sh
    if is_required_containerized; then
        echo "Environment is containerized"
    fi
    ```

* `is_containerized` -- returns true or false if environment is containerized works only against OSP12 and later
  - Example:
    ```sh
    if is_containerized; then
        echo "Environment is containerized"
    else
        echo "Environment is NOT containerized"
    fi
    ```

* `docker_runit` -- execute the command inside docker works only with docker
  - Example:
    ```sh
    # docker exec -i $(docker ps | grep rabbitmq-bundle | cut -d" " -f1) sh -c "rabbitmqctl report"
    docker_runit "rabbitmq-bundle" "rabbitmqctl report" | grep partitions
    ```

* `discover_rhrelease` -- find RH Release number based on /etc/redhat-release code name
  - Example:
    ```sh
    if [[ $(discover_rhrelease) -eq "7" ]] ; then
        echo "RHEL 7 detected"
    else
        echo "RHEL 7 not detected"
    fi
    ```
  - NOTE: It might return '0', so it's convenient in your scripts to run something like:
    ```sh
    [[ "${RELEASE}" -eq '0' ]] && echo "RH release undefined" >&2 && exit ${RC_SKIPPED}
    ```
    To early leave the script

* `is_pkg $pkg` -- returns package version if installed on system (RHEL/Centos/Fedora | Debian)
  - Example:
    ```sh
    # is_pkg systat
    sos-3.2-15.el7.noarch
    ```

* `is_required_pkg $pkg` -- continues if package is installed or exits with `$RC_SKIPPED` if required package is missing
  - Example:
    ```sh
    is_required_pkg sysstat
    ```

* `is_pkg_over $pkg` -- Checks if provided package is over specific release
  - Example:
    ```sh
    if is_pkg_over dracut dracut-033-502; then  ## Note, version string is DISTRO dependent
        echo "dracut is not affected by spectre"
    else
        echo "update dracut to get the fix for spectre vulnerability"
    fi
    ```

* `is_required_pkg_over $pkg` -- Checks if provided PKG is over specific release or exit as FAILED
  - Example:
    ```sh
    is_required_pkg_over dracut dracut-033-502
    ```

- `is_rpm $rpm` -- returns rpm name as installed on the system
  - Example:
    ```sh
    # is_rpm sos
    sos-3.2-15.el7.noarch

- `is_dpkg $dpkg` -- returns dpkg version as installed on the system
  - Example:
    ```sh
    # is_dpkg libc6
    2.12.1-0ubuntu10.2
    ```
