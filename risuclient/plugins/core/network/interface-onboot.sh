# description: Reports interfaces that its state 'up' and doesn't have ONBOOT='yes' in its network-scripts file.
# bugzilla: https://github.com/risuorg/risu/issues/535

# kb:

# Test cases
# 1 Give an invalid SOS_IP_ADDRESS_PATHS. Observe the fail.
# 2 Remove ONBOOT=yes from network file for the UP interfaces. Observe the fail.
